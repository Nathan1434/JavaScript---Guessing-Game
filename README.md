# JavaScript - Guessing Game

This is my very first JavaScript project. 

It is a guess-the-number game where the aim is guess the correct number that the computer generated. It contains a guide to notify you if the number is correct or if it is greater or less than your guess.

It also contains a history component where you can see previous guesses, and a start over button, if you wish to reset the game. 

Enjoy!
